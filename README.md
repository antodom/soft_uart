### 1. Introduction

This library is an implementation of a software UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) for the Arduino Due's Atmel ATSAM3X8E micro-controller.

Using this library you can have up to nine software serial ports on the Arduino DUE, in addition to the hardware serial ports already available on the Atmel ATSAM3X8E micro-controller, namely objects Serial, Serial1, Serial2 and Serial3.

The objects provided by this library for the software serial ports are: serial_tc0, serial_tc1, serial_tc2, serial_tc3, serial_tc4, serial_tc5, serial_tc6, serial_tc7 and serial_tc8. These software serial port objects can be used in the same way that its hardware correspondent Serial, Serial1, Serial2 and Serial3. Those objects are not defined by default, you must declare them before its use. Only the ones declared will be generated by the compiler. For declaring any of them you must use a specific macro. For example, for object serial_tc0, the macro would be serial_tc0_declaration, for serial_tc1, declare_serial_tc1, etc. In addition each object has a transmission and a reception buffer. The transmission buffer is a fifo, and the reception buffer is a circular fifo. Thus, when declaring each object you have also to specify the length in bytes of both buffers in the corresponding macro, like in the following code:

```
  // declaration of software serial port object serial_tc4
  // which uses timer/counter channel TC4
  serial_tc4_declaration(RX_BUF_LENGTH,TX_BUF_LENGTH);
```

Each software serial object implies the use of a Timer Counter (TC) module channel of the ATSAM3X8E. Remember that there are three timer counter modules on the micro-controller, each one with three channels. In total nine timer/counter channels denoted by TC0, TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4, TC5, TC6, TC7 and TC8, respectively. This library uses for implementing a software serial port a specific timer/counter channel. That is, TC0 for serial_tc0, TC1 for serial_tc1, etc. In addition, each software serial port object can be configured for using any pair of I/O pins available on the micro-controller as RX (reception) and TX (transmission) pins for the serial port.

For setting a software serial port object you must use member function begin(), where you specify the RX and TX pins, the serial bit (baud) rate, the data bits (5, 6, 7, 8 or 9), the parity (either no parity, or even or odd parity), and the use of one or two stop bits. The next snippet of code shows and example:

```
  // serial_tc4 initialization
  serial_tc4.begin(
    RX_PIN,
    TX_PIN,
    SOFT_UART_BIT_RATE,
    soft_uart::data_bit_codes::EIGHT_BITS,
    soft_uart::parity_codes::EVEN_PARITY,
    soft_uart::stop_bit_codes::ONE_STOP_BIT
  );
```
When using one of those software serial port objects, the TC channel and the RX and TX pins involved can only be used for this purpose, if not its functionality is compromised. Take into account that interrupts for the TC channel and the RX pin involved are used intensively when associated to any of the software serial port objects.

### 2. Download & installation

The  library  is  available  through  an  open	git  repository  available   at:

* <http://bizet.dis.ulpgc.es/antodom/soft_uart>

For using it you just have to copy the library on the libraries folder used by your Arduino IDE, the folder should be named "soft_uart".

In addition you must add the flag -std=gnu++11 for compiling. For doing that add -std=gnu++11 to the platform.txt file, concretely to compiler.cpp.flags.

### 3. Examples

On the examples directory you have available a couple of examples illustrating the use of soft_uart.

Example *soft_uart_serial_test.ino* uses software serial port object serial_tc4 with pins 10 and 11, as RX and TX pins respectively, and Serial2. For having this example working, you should connect the RX pin of Serial2 to pin 11, and Serial2's TX pin to pin 10. Mind that soft_uart software serial objects can be used in the same way that Serial, Serial1, Serial2 and Serial3 hardware serial objects.

Example *soft_uart_serial_test_auto.ino* illustrates how to use a serial port object with itself, in this case serial_tc4, like in the previous example. In addition, the example uses also a serial mode of 9 bit length which is not possible with the current Arduino standard library. 

### 4. Reception errors

The behavior of the software serial objects provided by soft_uart will depend on the load of interrupts per unit of time of the application where you integrate them. Also on the peaks of interrupts in a given moment. Using the example provided I have reached to 57600 (and two stop bits) without errors. Evidently it is an example where there is no a great use of interrupts, except the ones used by the software serial object serial_tc4, and hardware serial objects Serial and Serial2. I advise you to check first for the best bit rate your application can manage without errors.

Independently of the application where you use this library, what is important is to know when any data have been received incorrectly. Thus, this library allows you to know the reception status of the last received byte. In general, for any received byte using member function read() you should check if read() returns -1 or not. When it returns -1, it may be due to that there is no available data, or on the contrary, the data received have an error. The next code illustrates how to proceed using serial_tc4 software serial object to find out the status of the last data received in those situations.

```
  if(serial_tc4.available()) 
  {
    int data=serial_tc4.read();
    if(data>0) 
    {
      // data received correctly
      Serial.print(static_cast<char>(data));
      if(serial_tc4.data_lost()) Serial.print("[DATA_LOST]");
    }
    else if(serial_tc4.bad_status())
    {
      // when serial_tc4.read() is negative, it means that there is no data
      // available or that the last data received was erroneous (this is
      // what we check with serial_tc4.bad_status(). If the last data was
      // erroneus we can check the reason with member functions bad_start_bit(),
      // bad_parity() and bad_stop_bit()
      if(serial_tc4.bad_start_bit()) Serial.print("[BAD_START_BIT]");
      if(serial_tc4.bad_parity()) Serial.print("[BAD_PARITY]");
      if(serial_tc4.bad_stop_bit()) Serial.print("[BAD_STOP_BIT]");
    }
  } 
```

In addition, it is also possible to know that some data have been lost on reception, due to that the reception buffer was full (using member function data_lost()). Take into account that the reception buffer is a circular fifo buffer that overwrites the older element when a new element is received and the buffer is full.

### 5. Incompatibilities

Any library using the interrupts associated with any of the timer/counter module channels TC0, TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4, TC5, TC6, TC7 and TC8, has a potential compatibility problem with soft_uart, if it happens to use the same TC module and the same channel. An example of this potential incompatibility is library Servo which uses by default TC0, TC2, TC3, TC4 y TC5 interrupt handlers. In this case, you will be limited to use serial_tc1, serial_tc6, serial_tc7 and/or serial_tc8 software serial objects to preserve the compatibility. Another option could also be to change the Servo library to use less TC modules.
